# LATENT_FINGER_PRINT_ANALYSIS

We applied various filters and image enhancement techniques on a dataset containing latent fingerprint images, to get better fingerprint identification. Carried out various combinations of filtering techniques, allowing us to study if there are certain filter
combinations that perform better than other filtering techniques (on the majority of data).
On running the file main_prototype.m we can see the effect of various filter applied on the image and how the order of theese filters results in the final image. 
The dataset here was quite limited and currently only one picture is uploaded in this repository. Previously openly available mnist data for latent fingerprints is no longer available for open access.
